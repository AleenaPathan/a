# Tweet Scheduler Project

## Introduction

This project automates the process of posting tweets to Twitter at scheduled times. It reads tweet content and scheduling details from a Google Sheet, posts the tweets using the Twitter API, and updates the Google Sheet with the tweet status. 

The script is written in Python and utilizes the `tweepy`, `gspread`, and `schedule` libraries to manage Twitter integration, Google Sheets interaction, and task scheduling.
